Package frodo implements Foundational Recursive Orthogonal Development Orders in
a wise way for Davsk Ltd Co CASE tools. First run acquires user info, verifies
dev env and installs CASE tools. Program may be run again to perform specific
actions.

OVERVIEW

Frodo may be deployed on any platform as a CLI or GUI app. It is used as a
wrapper for a variety of CASE tools. It is very much a dynamic work in progress
and should not be considered stable at this time.

BUG(david@davsk.net): This is an ALPHA package under development.
